# ws_canvas

* Download a zip of this `ws_canvas` repository
  or (preferably) clone it thus:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/portsoc/ws_canvas.git
```
* From your new local `ws_canvas` folder,
  open `index.html` in a browser to see which tests fail.
* Edit `index.js`; improving and adding code until all the tests pass.
* Check `test.js` to see each test that you need to work on.
* Notice that test tasks are all visual so you
  need to manually inspect the results.

For inspiration, you can use the [Stick Figures examples](https://github.com/portsoc/Web-Canvas-Stick-Figures).
