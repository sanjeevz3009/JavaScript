/* The 'old way' of having dynamic content is to

 * stylesheet.  It has to go at the end so it
 * can override anything that has been previously
 * set.
 *
 * In this example that's fairly easy to understand,
 * but in a real system with a longer and more complex
 * set of styles, this becomes very difficult to maintain.
